# Voice Based E-mail for Visually Challenged People

## Abstract:
We have seen that the inception of the Internet has dramatically revolutionized many fields. The Internet has made the life of people so easy that people today have access to any information they want sitting in their homes. One of the main fields that the Internet has revolutionized is communication. When talking about communication over the Internet, the first thing that comes to our mind is E-mail. 

E-mails are considered to be the most reliable way of communication over the Internet, for sending or receiving important information. But there is a special criterion for humans to access the Internet and the criteria is you must be able to see. 

You must be thinking that what sort of criteria is this, everyone with eyes can see. But there are also specially-abled people in our society who are not gifted with what you have. A survey shows that there are more than 250 million visually challenged people around the globe. That is, around 250 million people are unaware of how to use the Internet or E-mail. 

The only way by which a visually impaired person can send an E-mail is, they have to dictate the entire content of the mail to a third person (not visually challenged ) and then the third person will compose the mail and send it on the behalf of the visually impaired person. But this is not the correct way to deal with this problem. It is very less likely that a visually challenged person can find someone for help every time. 

Although for these reasons specially-abled people are criticized by our society. So, for the betterment of society and giving equal status to such specially-abled people, we have come up with this project idea which allows the user to send mails using voice commands without the need for a keyboard or any other visual things.

In Our Project, the database is considered to be the main pillar of every project. In our application, a database is used to store user details such as name, age, etc. The database here is also used to keep information about the emails sent or received or in the draft.


# Introduction

Every human being is widely accessing knowledge and information and also uses it for communication through the internet. However, blind people face difficulties in accessing these net-based information, also in using any service provided through the internet. Due to its simplicity and accessibility, the Internet is widely used in almost all communication applications. In recent times, numerous applications based on the internet have been developed to make communication more reliable and efficient. Out of these numerous applications, E-mail is the most widely used and reliable way to communicate with each other.

The usage of e-mail is quite easy and lucid for regular users, but when it comes to users with visual defects, the system is yet very difficult to use. The current system is not useful for people with visual defects as the available systems are based on visual perceptions. However, there are significant advancements in technologies nowadays, especially for visually challenged people. The advancement in computer-based accessible systems has opened up many possibilities for the visually impaired across the world in a wide way. Audio-based virtual environments like screen readers and many voice-based search engines have helped blind people to access internet applications immensely. 

The contribution made by this research has enabled blind people to send and receive voice-based e-mail messages with the help of a computer.

## Artificial Intelligence for Speech Recognition

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology used for creating intelligent systems and machines that simulate human intelligence. Some artificial intelligence applications include various expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), machine vision, and speech recognition. Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves understanding and analyzing human language such as English by extracting metadata from keywords, emotions, relations, and concepts.

## Problem Definition

The visually challenged people find it very difficult to utilize this technology because using them requires visual perception. However, not all people can use the internet. This is because in order to access the internet you would need to know what is written on the screen. If that is not visible, it is of no use. This makes the internet a completely useless technology for the visually impaired and illiterate people.

## Existing System

Simple e-mail systems are available in which only voice recognition and text-to-speech systems are accessible by remembering the keyboard shortcuts to access. The existing voice-based e-mail system has made use of IVR, Speech to text converter, Mouse click event, and Screen reader. There will be a small icon of a mic on which clicking the user had to speak and his/her speech will be converted to text format, which the blind people would see and read also, as in references.

### Disadvantages:

- User have to use a mouse connected to the computer and should perform mouse click events to send and receive emails.
- In the existing system, they have chosen Web UI as the interface for the system which is not easy for impaired people to use.
- The existing mail services do not provide easy access to visually challenged people because they are in written format or any type of attached information and there is no read-out option to hear the mail that is received to their mail addresses.

## Proposed System

Because using this technology involves visual perception, it is extremely difficult for visually impaired persons to use it. This is because in order to access the internet you would need to know what is written on the screen, which is not possible for a blind person. In this proposed system, it mainly concentrates on four different types of technologies:

- Speech-to-Text (STT): This module collects the speech given by the user and converts it to Text.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS): This converts the response given to the system to Speech.
- Chatbot: For making the conversation more sensible and for giving responses more like a human.
- Mail Communication Module: For sending and receiving emails.

### Advantages:

- Doesnâ€™t need any mouse click events to send and receive emails.
- Purely based on the voice commands given by the user.
- Chatbot is used to make the conversation smooth and more like a human response.
- User-friendly (as Blind person can easily use a web-based application).
- Easy Storage of data.
- More efficient.
- Requires less effort and time.
- The system that we are developing is entirely different from the existing ones. Unlike other systems which focus only on a particular set of people, our system is focused on visually challenged people too.
- It also helps handicapped and illiterate people.

# Literature Survey

In this section, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the existing related technical issues. In [2], and in a voice of the architectural email, it is proposed that it helps blind people access the email. The current system is not blind, as it does not give a sound opinion about the reading of its content. The proposed system uses speech recognition, Interactive voice response, and a click of the mouse. In addition, for added security, the purpose, the device is used to authenticate the user. The first module will be registered in the system. This module will collect all of a user's information and tell them what information you will enter. In the second module, the login module, the system prompts the user to enter a user name and a password. Do this with the help of voice commands.
To perform the voice of the check, you will need more tests and voice. The user is then redirected to the inbox page after the registration has been completed. Once you have logged in, the user can carry out the normal operation of the mail system. System Settings: How To Create Email Account, Email, It's Trash. The user can switch between them with the help of voice commands. The paper proposes a system that relies on a system with a voice command, based on that, in contrast to the pre-existing email system. The whole system is, in essence, is based on converting the number to text. Once made use, the implementation of the system will prompt the user to speak commands to make use of the relevant services. If the user wants to access the relevant services, it is necessary to state that this command will work. This program uses the IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol). This is a standard Internet protocol used by an email to send an email from a mail server over TCP / IP. The main type of activity, the screen, will be the first screen displayed from the beginning of the year. On this screen, waiting for the user to press a single button, and the system will start to receive your voice commands. It's a full-size single button to tap anywhere on the screen. Then, with the help of voice commands, the user can send an email to read it. In [4]. the system uses three main technologies:
- To convert the number to text 
- Text-to-speech. 
- Interactive Voice Response. 

When you are visiting the site for the first time, it needs to register with the help of voice commands. Also, once you register, the user's audio data and a note will be saved in the database. And the user will receive a user id and password after the user logs in to receive an email in such a system. The user interface has been developed with the help of Adobe Dreamweaver CS3. The site is primarily centered on the concept of efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, there is a "Contacts" page, where the user can offer any suggestions or any help if they need it. At the time, one of the e-system is proposed, which is easily accessible for the blind. You can use the voice-to-text converter-text-to-speech converter and the Viterbi algorithm. The algorithmic rule, which is working with the technology, does not find it to be the most appropriate word; as soon as the user says so, so it is, as your guessed word, for a given the word pronounced. The user registers at the site where they are for the first time, the visit to the site. This system will reduce some of the disadvantages of the current system. Sorry, this scheme is the efficiency of the Viterbi algorithm to reduce the number of errors will increase and require more space. a system for the blind and the illiterate is proposed to improve their interaction with the email system. This system eliminates the use of IVR technology that are using screen readers, Braille keyboards. There, we used the speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion. Voice commands are also used for other activities as well. For registration, you may use your identity, your email address, and your password. This is functionality to use the function that tells PHP to email. This is the library, which you can use to send an email. To obtain the user's email from the IMAP server. This Lash-Morris-Pratt algorithm is used to search for email collection boxes. Thus, the system's environment is clean, the voice-controlled by a feedback system in each step. Sorry, this scheme is that it uses Gmail as a host server so that we can make use of other email services like Yahoo, Google, etc. Proposed a voting scheme, which is based on the PCs and mobile devices for the blind. They are the most important elements found in the system's work in the note below. 

1. G-mail system messages, refer to the buyer's email.
2. RSS-Real simple syndication news 
3. Let's listen to the music 
4. The system's red book and reader 
5. Search for your discs and folders using the bridge's Browser. 

It is a software architecture used for the blind, with easy access to the email and MMS messaging functionality into the operating system. The graphical user interface design can be achieved with the help of voice commands and a mouse, but with the help of the keyboard. RSS feeds are also used along with email, which is simple syndication to distribute a list of headlines, announcements of new products and services. We have also prepared an application for you. Along with email, other apps can be accessed by using a voice command. The authors propose the Tetra-Entry, a blind-friendly email client, to overcome the favorability and the convenience of email activities.
The number of blind people is rapidly increasing, so the research's main goal is to develop a simple, inexpensive, user-friendly, and compact device that allows visually impaired people to use multimedia applications of operating systems such as text, music player, and dialing system by integrating a GSM module. All of the forementioned features are included on a low-cost Raspberry Pi board. At the period, [16], one of the E-Systems that is easily accessible to the blind is proposed. 
You can use the Viterbi method, as well as the voice-to-text and text-to-speech converters. The computational rule that works with the technology does not determine it to be the most acceptable word; yet, as soon as the user says it, it is spoken as your guessed word for a particular word. The user creates an account on the site that they are visiting or the first time. This system will mitigate some of the present system's drawbacks. Sorry, but the Viterbi algorithm's efficiency in reducing the number of errors will increase, requiring more space.  
A solution for the blind and illiterate to better their interaction with the email system is proposed in. This technique eliminates the need for screen readers and Braille keyboards while using IVR technology. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversions were utilized there. Voice instructions are also employed for a variety of different tasks. Your identity, email address, and password can all be used to register. This is the ability to use the function that instructs PHP to send an email. This is the email library from which you can send an email. The IMAP server is used to retrieve the user's email. To find email collection boxes.
