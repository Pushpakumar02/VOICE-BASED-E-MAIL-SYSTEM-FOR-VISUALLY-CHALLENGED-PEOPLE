# Voice Based E-mail for Visually Challenged People

## Abstract:
We have seen that the inception of the Internet has dramatically revolutionized many fields. The Internet has made the life of people so easy that people today have access to any information they want sitting in their homes. One of the main fields that the Internet has revolutionized is communication. When talking about communication over the Internet, the first thing that comes to our mind is E-mail. 

E-mails are considered to be the most reliable way of communication over the Internet, for sending or receiving important information. But there is a special criterion for humans to access the Internet and the criteria is you must be able to see. 

You must be thinking that what sort of criteria is this, everyone with eyes can see. But there are also specially-abled people in our society who are not gifted with what you have. A survey shows that there are more than 250 million visually challenged people around the globe. That is, around 250 million people are unaware of how to use the Internet or E-mail. 

The only way by which a visually impaired person can send an E-mail is, they have to dictate the entire content of the mail to a third person (not visually challenged ) and then the third person will compose the mail and send it on the behalf of the visually impaired person. But this is not the correct way to deal with this problem. It is very less likely that a visually challenged person can find someone for help every time. 

Although for these reasons specially-abled people are criticized by our society. So, for the betterment of society and giving equal status to such specially-abled people, we have come up with this project idea which allows the user to send mails using voice commands without the need for a keyboard or any other visual things.

In Our Project, the database is considered to be the main pillar of every project. In our application, a database is used to store user details such as name, age, etc. The database here is also used to keep information about the emails sent or received or in the draft.
